                    The chicken is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl,
                     with attributes of wild species such as grey and ceylon junglefowl 
                     that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term
                      for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel.

                     numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat.</p>
